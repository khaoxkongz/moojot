# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

This repo is **multi-context**: one context per workspace (`packages/*`, `apps/*`).

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY-MAP.md`** at the repo root: it points at one `GLOSSARY.md` per workspace. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read system-wide ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. Also check `<workspace>/docs/adr/` (e.g. `packages/api/docs/adr/`) for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

        └── docs/adr/
```

When a new workspace gets a `GLOSSARY.md`, add a row for it in `GLOSSARY-MAP.md`.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in the relevant `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
